# Ted-Talk-Views-Prediction

TED Conferences, LLC, known for its TED Talks, is a non-profit media organization founded in 1984. Initially focused on technology and design, TED has expanded to cover various subjects such as science, culture, politics, and academia. TED Talks, available since 2006, have gained immense popularity, with over 3,500 talks and one billion views worldwide. TED events are held globally, and independently organized TEDx events are hosted in over 150 countries. TED's mission is to provide a platform for sharing inspiring ideas with a global audience.

Predicting the popularity of TEDTalks is challenging due to factors influencing viewer engagement and the diverse range of topics covered. Machine learning techniques, like regression models and neural networks, are commonly employed to predict TEDTalk views. Features such as metadata (e.g., speaker reputation, talk duration) and textual content (e.g., title, transcript) are used to analyze relationships with view counts. Speaker reputation and topic relevance significantly impact viewership. Additionally, the timing of talk publication and effective promotion through various channels, including social media, can influence a talk's popularity.

Predictive models for TEDTalk views are trained using historical data, leveraging features and view counts of previously published talks. Machine learning algorithms learn patterns from this data to make predictions about the view counts of new talks. While these models provide estimates, accurately predicting actual view counts can be challenging due to changing viewer preferences and external factors. Nonetheless, they offer valuable insights for TED organizers and speakers to optimize their strategies for reaching a larger audience and understanding the potential impact of their talks.

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the number of views for TEDx videos. By analyzing various video features, the model aims to predict viewership levels, benefiting TEDx organizers, content creators, and viewers. The model will help identify factors contributing to higher viewership and guide decisions regarding video promotion, content selection, and audience engagement. Ultimately, the goal is to create a reliable and effective tool that optimizes the reach and impact of TEDx videos, providing insights into their potential viewership.
